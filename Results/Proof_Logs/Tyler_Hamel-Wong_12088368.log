=== TEST 1 (20 rows, 10 columns) ===

INFINITE LOOP DETECTED!

Student implemented the letter rectangle correctly BUT wrapped the entire program 
in an infinite loop that was meant for testing.

Problem code (line 14 in assignment1.cpp):
    while (true){ //This was not asked for but made testing and debugging 100x easier.

Student's comment shows this was intentional for testing purposes, but it was 
never removed before submission.

What happens:
1. Program correctly draws the letter rectangle for test 1
2. Instead of ending, it loops back to beginning due to while(true)
3. Asks for input again: "Please enter the size of the box..."
4. No more input available from automated test
5. Program hangs waiting for input infinitely
6. Terminated after 5-second timeout

Impact:
- The letter rectangle logic itself appears to be correct
- However, the infinite loop makes the program unusable
- Cannot complete any test case because it never exits
- This is a critical error: forgot to remove debugging/testing code


=== TEST 2 (26 rows, 40 columns) ===
Did not reach test 2 due to timeout in test 1.
