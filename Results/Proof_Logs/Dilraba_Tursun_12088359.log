=== TEST 1 (20 rows, 10 columns) ===

WRONG PROGRAM SUBMITTED!

Student submitted a unit converter program instead of the letter rectangle assignment.

Program code analysis shows:
- This is a "UNIT CONVERTER" menu-driven program
- Expects menu choices (1-5) for conversions: Meters↔Feet, Kilograms↔Pounds
- Uses a do-while loop that continues until user selects option 5 (Exit)

Why it times out:
1. Test sends "20" as input (intended for rows)
   → Program reads this as menu choice
   → Invalid choice (only 1-5 valid)
   → Prints error and loops back to menu
   
2. Test sends "10" as input (intended for columns)  
   → Program reads this as menu choice
   → Invalid choice again
   → Loops back to menu
   
3. No more input available, but program keeps looping
   → Infinite loop printing menu repeatedly
   → Terminated after 5-second timeout

This is NOT the letter rectangle assignment.


=== TEST 2 (26 rows, 40 columns) ===
Did not reach test 2 due to timeout in test 1.
